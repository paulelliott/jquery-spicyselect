jQuery Spicy Select Plugin

This plugin allows you to apply custom styles to your select boxes.  You can invoke it on a standard select box and it will hide it and write out a "div.spicyselect > ol > li" DOM structure in its place. All interactions with the div work the same way that the select does and when values are selected in the div, they are updated in the select.  The value of the select is always current and will be posted with the form as if you had used it directly.

Features:

  * default value for select is carried over to spicyselect
  * support for optgroups (labels are not selectable)
  * any classes present on the select or its options are carried over to the div and li's, respectively
  * sliding animations are toggleable
  * the select's change event is fired when the user selects a spicyselect option
  * up and down arrows will move current selection through options
  * enter or select will choose current option
  * typing a name while focused will select the first occurrance that contains it (backspace will start over)

Example:

  $("select").spicyselect();

  If you were to call it on this select:

    <select id="test_select" style="display: none;">
      <option value="">Valueless Option</option>
      <option>Basic Option</option>
      <option value="awesome">Awesome Option</option>
      <option class="classy">Classy Option</option>
      <optgroup label="Incredible Option Group!">
        <option value="incredibility">Option Groups Rock</option>
        <option>This Really Is Spicy!</option>
      </optgroup>
    </select>

  It would write out this DOM structure:

    <div id="test_select_mask" class="spicyselect ">
      <a>Valueless Option</a>
      <ol>
        <li class="">Basic Option</li>
        <li class="">Awesome Option</li>
        <li class="classy">Classy Option</li>
        <ol>
          <li class="optgroup_label">Incredible Option Group!</li>
          <li class="">Option Groups Rock</li>
          <li class="">This Really Is Spicy!</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </div>

  To style it, you can count on it to have a class of 'spicyselect', have any classes present on the original select, and have an id of (select.id + "_mask"). When it receives focus, a "focus" class will also be added to the mask. You can download a sample stylesheet from the demo page.

Options:

  defaultText

    default value: ""
    Sets the default text to display when there is no option selected.  This will be overriden by a default option, if one is present.

  animate

    default value: true
    Causes the showing and hiding of the options to use a fast sliding animation.  Setting to false will change it to a regular show/hide.
